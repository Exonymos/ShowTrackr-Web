## Overview

ShowTrackr provides a private, free, and straightforward way to manage your media watchlist directly on your own computer. No cloud accounts, no data collection, just your list, your way.

It uses a modern web stack (Python/Flask backend, HTMX for dynamic frontend updates without full page reloads) and is styled with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for a clean, responsive, and themeable interface. All your data is stored locally in a simple SQLite database file, ensuring privacy and portability.
